# k-mean-cluster-algorithm

Description:
k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal
processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering
aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs
to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.
